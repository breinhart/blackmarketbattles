# Black Market Battles

Black Market Battles is my entry into the League of Legends API challenge.  I was a bit rushed for time, so there is a lot I would like to do with this site.  But first off, here is how you play.

## Tutorial
- First off, create a name for yourself on the home page.
- Once you are in the lobby, you can host a game or join another game.  Hopefully this site will just be booming with hosted rooms :P
- Now that you are in a game, the fun begins!
- - Betting phase!  Try your best guess at which team you think won the matchup.  Put a wager on it if you are confident.
- - Battle phase!  Use your new found Kraken to attack your opponent or heal yourself.  You only get one action per turn!
- - Rinse and Repeat.  Simple, right?

### More coming soon!!

- Champion Selection - choose a champ to play as
- Use your champion abilities instead of simple attack/heal
- Buy items with your kraken to increase your skills and auto attacks
- Better UI - If you want to help me with this, please contact me!
